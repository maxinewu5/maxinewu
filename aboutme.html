            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Maxine Wu, a junior at American High School. I like listening to music, watching movies, and reading the comment section on AOC's Tweets. In my free time, you'll often find me absolutely destroying my brother in 8Ball or chilling with my friends on Zoom calls.</p>            </p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>At American, I'm involved with VEX Robotics Thing One and Girls Who Code. I really love being able to learn more about programming and meet others who share my love of technology. It's rewarding to be able to build cool things like robots with your friends. Outside of American, I volunteer to teach math at my elementary school's Math Olympiad program. </p>        </div>

            <h2>Vacations</h2>
            <p>In winter, when I have the chance, I like to head up to Tahoe to ski (and occasionally snowboard, though I haven't mastered the skill of being able to turn without falling over completely yet).  There's nothing like the feeling of tired adrenaline after a long, cold day out in the snow.</p>        </div>
